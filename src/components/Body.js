        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Full-stack web developer. Experienced entertainer, audio-engineer,
          musician, and composer. I prefer to work in a position that encourages
          creativity and problem-solving. I thrive in team environments and am
          always trying to learn new technologies. I am passionate about music
          and am a self-taught music producer. I love the great outdoors and
          grew up going to Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado. I've worked
          in the wedding industry for most of my career before pursuing
          programming.
